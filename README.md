## Introduction

**Agile Base Board** is a lightweight, web-based Kanban-style task management board designed to help you organize tasks efficiently.  
It allows you to create columns (e.g., To Do, In Progress, Done), add and edit items, reorder columns and items via drag-and-drop or touch, and manage your workflow visually.  
All changes are reflected in real-time, and the board can be exported or imported as a JSON file for backup, sharing, or migration purposes.
